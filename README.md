# SpotiFlow - Groove to the Flow!

## About

This application was made as for a final project as a part of the course COMS4170 - User Interface Design at Columbia University, Fall 2015. It uses the Spotify and Spotify EchoNest API to allow users to search for music and output their playlist in the form of an output flow for their particular event.
